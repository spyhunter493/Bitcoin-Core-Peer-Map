Unreleased - Rebranded internals for Bitcoin Peer Map. Renamed the native launcher, Python package, frontend assets, configuration keys, browser storage, Docker service, image, user, paths, and persistent volume. This is a clean break from the previous internal naming and starts with fresh application data.

v7.8.1 — README.md minor edit

v7.8.0 — Fixed donut hover overriding peer selection. When a peer was selected from the peer list, hovering over the donut chart would draw lines to all peers in the hovered AS segment, overriding the single-peer focus. Donut hover and leave events now fully block when a peer detail panel is active, matching the existing behavior when navigating through donut sub-menus.

v7.7.4 — Fixed service flag abbreviations showing only the first character of each flag name (e.g. NETWORK_LIMITED displayed as "N" instead of "NL", COMPACT_FILTERS as "C" instead of "CF"). Backend now uses a proper abbreviation map. Fixed frontend expand functions that were splitting on "/" instead of whitespace, preventing tooltip expansion of individual flags.

v7.7.3 — Fixed provider filter expansion bug where 10-second data refreshes expanded preview lines beyond the active category filter (e.g. hovering a provider while filtered to IPv6 would briefly show all that provider's peers). Added 3-level drill-down for Others in Connections by Provider (Others row → provider list → peer list) with refresh state preservation. Added "Open Others panel" navigation link at the top of the Others provider list sub-tooltip. Added "* Private Networks" link in the Networks section (below IPv4/IPv6) that switches to Private Network Mode, always visible regardless of whether private peers are connected. Added clickable panel links on Tor/I2P/CJDNS sub-tooltip headers. Fixed missing hover and click highlight on the Others row in Connections by Provider.

v7.7.1 — Fixed public donut staying expanded with stale provider name in center after dismissing a "Connections by Provider" sub-filter via map click or Escape key. Fixed private network donut center not showing selected peer info (#ID, network, direction) when clicking a peer from a sub-menu — deferred mouseleave events from the hidden tooltip were overwriting the peer text with stale category preview data.

v7.7.0 — Added Scores & Insights rectangle to the Private Network donut with hover preview, click-to-select, line drawing, and data refresh persistence. Added Display Top ISP/Net toggle in Map Settings (default OFF) that hides legend lists and shows provider info directly in donut centers on slice hover. Fixed multi-level panel preview, selection highlighting, and data refresh state preservation across both public and private donuts.

v7.6.7 — Fixed donut center text not updating when IPv4 or IPv6 network panel is selected from the top bar. The center now shows "N PEERS / IPv4 / X% of peers" (with network color) and correctly preserves this through 10-second data refreshes, hover previews, and sub-filter drill-downs within the network panel.

v7.6.6 — Redesigned donut center text for both public and private donuts. Public donut now shows "ISP" label (was "Internet Provider:") with provider name in display font, AS number, and peer count. Private donut center shows "X PEERS / NETWORK NAME / % of anonymous peers" layout with "PRIVATE NETWORKS / % of total connections" as the default. Added hover preview in donut center for Others popup provider list. Fixed map update bug where 10-second data refreshes would overwrite donut center text, resetting hover previews and pinned selections in both public and private donuts. Removed font-size CSS transition on PN donut to prevent flash of huge text when switching modes. Removed colored dots from private network overview panel rows.

v7.6.5 — Minor bug fixes and UI improvements.

v7.6.4 — Dedicated IPv4/IPv6 network panels with full drill-down from top bar chips, darker TOR color, and comprehensive refresh stability fixes for network panel dim state, sub-filter persistence, and panel close behavior. Updated README with Private Network Mode documentation and new screenshots.

v7.6.2 — Fixed private network panel rows displaying peer counts jammed against the network name (e.g. "Tor6") instead of right-aligned. Added flex layout to panel interactive rows to match the public AS diversity panel styling.

v7.6.1 — Refined Private Network Mode interactions: mini donut segments now hover-preview and click-enter specific networks, donut selection persists through map refreshes, and clicking blank map space progressively deselects. Panel row hover previews lines to grouped peers, sub-tooltip peer hover previews individual connections, and flight deck chips correctly route to the right network panel.

v7.6.0 — New Private Network Mode for Tor, I2P, and CJDNS peers with dedicated donut visualization, overview panel, and Antarctica map zoom. Flight deck network chips now toggle between public and private modes. Collapsible AS legend keeps the right-side layout clean.

v7.5.4 — Added network badge, resize handle, and 20 new getpeerinfo fields to the peer detail popup. Rewrote README opening and added full peer popup documentation with new screenshot.

v7.5.3 — Fixed donut chart not updating immediately when clicking category rows or toggling connection grid items. Others popup now stays open when selecting a sub-provider for easy switching, with proper map line restoration on hover.

v7.5.2 — Fixed ISP panel scroll reset on data refresh, replaced oval donut morph with a floating popup for Others sub-providers, and fixed broken drill-down interactivity for all Others provider panels. Added "← Others" back navigation in the donut center and service flag descriptions to the Summary panel tooltips.

v7.5.1 — Fixed peer focus being lost on auto-refresh: clicking a map dot now correctly stays zoomed and focused on the selected peer through data update cycles instead of resetting to show all lines. Summary and provider panels now scroll back to the top when reopened.

v7.5.0 — Complete overhaul of peer selection, zoom, and panel interaction behavior. Clicking any peer (map dot, multi-peer group, or table row) now consistently zooms to the peer, opens the detail popup, draws a single connection line, and persists through 10-second data refreshes. Fixed hover-preview vs click-select state separation so hovering other items previews them without losing the active selection.
